
Write a program to find x to the power n (i.e. x^n). Take x and n from the user. You need to print the answer.
Note : For this question, you can assume that 0 raised to the power of 0 is 1


Input format :
Two integers x and n (separated by space)
Output Format :
x^n (i.e. x raise to the power n)
Constraints:
0 <= x <= 8 
0 <= n <= 9
Sample Input 1 :
 3 4
Sample Output 1 :
81
Sample Input 2 :
 2 5
Sample Output 2 :
32

    cin>>x;
    cin>>y;
    
    int ans = 1;                               
    int i = 0;                                   
    while(i < y)
    {
        ans = ans*x;
        i++;
    }
    
    cout << ans <<endl;
    
    return 0;
